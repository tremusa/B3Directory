This is the B3 directory plugin for Wordpress.
To use, clone this repo and upload the folder to wp-content/plugins/.
You can then activate from within Wordpress. Please feel free to contribute in any way you can. My only request is when you submit a pull request make sure your code is SECURE and well-organized. Currently there is no official code style being used for the code. Use PHP-cs-fixer to clean up your code if it isn't well formatted.
